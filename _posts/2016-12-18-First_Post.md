This site will provide status updates as projects are developed and I contribute to other GitHub projects.  My goal is to improve coding skills and contribute to other projects to begin working in a collaborative environment instead of only on single projects.  Most of my focus to this point has been writing scripts in Perl and PHP.  In addition to creating various scripts, I have also been spending considerable time developing advanced SQL queries.
